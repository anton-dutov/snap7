# snap7

Rust bindings to [snap7](http://snap7.sourceforge.net/) library

Snap7 is an open source, 32/64 bit, multi-platform Ethernet communication suite for interfacing natively with Siemens S7 PLCs. The new CPUs 1200/1500, the old S7200, the small LOGO 0BA7/0BA8 and SINAMICS Drives are also partially supported.

Although it has been designed to overcome the limitations of OPC servers when transferring large amounts of high speed data in industrial facilities, it scales well down to small Linux based arm or mips boards such as Raspberry PI (1 and 2) , BeagleBone Black, pcDuino, CubieBoard, UDOO and ARDUINO YUN.

Three specialized components, Client, Server and Partner, allow you to definitively integrate your PC based systems into a PLC automation chain.
